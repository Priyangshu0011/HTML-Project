      <h2>Animal Rescue: What You Need to Know to Start Rescuing Animals Today</h2>
      <p>Animal rescue is a much-needed social service that helps protect animals from dangerous situations that often
        involve cruelty and abuse. Many animals are turned into shelters due to evictions, expensive health concerns, or
        other unavoidable circumstances. Often it is easy to villainize the people who surrender their animals, but as
        animal advocates, we must keep in mind that oftentimes people are surrendering as they believe it is best for
        the
        animal or they’ve tried everything else.</p>

      <h3>What Is Animal Rescue?</h3>
      <h3>What Is the Difference Between an Animal Rescue and an Animal Shelter? </h3>

      <p>The differences between animal shelters and animal rescues can be difficult to nail down. This is because there
        is a great level of ambiguity and flexibility surrounding the two terms. Some places that interpret the term
        “animal rescue” broadly might even house animal shelters as a subset of animal rescues. If there were to be a
        key
        difference it would be that generally speaking, animal shelters tend to have facilities that house animals
        whereas
        animal rescues are typically foster-based organizations. This does not mean, however, that animal shelters do
        not
        have fosters, as many do. Many animal rescues also partner with boarding facilities to house their animals
        adding
        to the ambiguity between the two. Regardless of what they call themselves, both types of organizations have a
        common goal: they exist to help animals. </p>

      <h3>Which Animals Suffer the Most? </h3>
      <p>There are farm sanctuaries that focus on helping rescued farmed animals and allowing them to live out their
        lives in peace. There are municipal shelters that handle cruelty seizures and help to rehome dogs and cats. If
        there is an animal in need, there is likely an organization that has stepped up to help, this is especially true
        of the species that are most frequently in need.</p>

      <h3>Dogs</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Every year an estimated 3.1 million dogs enter shelters across the United States. Though this number is
          staggering it has fallen sharply from the estimated 3.9 million dogs that entered shelters in 2011. These dogs
          come as strays, owner surrenders, cruelty seizures to receive care and rehabilitation at shelters. Though
          there are many rescues that accept strays or owner surrenders, many also focus on pulling dogs from animal
          shelters in order to make space for additional intakes and continue the ongoing trend of reducing the number
          of dogs euthanized every year in shelters. </p>

      <h3>Cats</h3>
      <section>
        <p>The American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates that 3.2 million cats enter animal
          shelters in the United States every year. Cats of all ages, conditions, and with a vast array of needs enter
          the shelter doors for staff to route to appropriate outcomes whether that be transfer to a facility or rescue
          better able to care for that animal’s needs, placing them up for adoption, or seeking a return to their owner.

      <h3>Horses</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Estimates of how many horses are in rescues in the United States range between 6,000 to 10,000. These horses
          are typically rehomed due to their health, behavioral issues, or a lack of suitability for their intended
          purpose. </p>
      </section>
      <h3>Wildlife</h3>
      <section>
        <p>
          Like domesticated animals, wildlife often find themselves in need of rescue. Most wildlife that is rescued
          will be rehabilitated with the goal of eventual release back into the wild. The animals that can’t be released
          will either be humanely euthanized due to their condition or kept in captivity at a sanctuary, zoo, or another
          appropriate facility capable of providing adequate care.</p>
